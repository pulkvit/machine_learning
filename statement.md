# Problem Statement

Organizations often need a reliable method to estimate the expected salary of an employee based on their years of work experience. Manual estimations are subjective and may vary from person to person.  
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict salary using years of experience as the input feature.  
The solution will be simple, data-driven, and demonstrate how regression models learn relationships in data.

# Scope of the Project

The scope of the project includes:
- Loading and analyzing a dataset containing years of experience and corresponding salary values.
- Preprocessing and splitting the dataset into training and testing parts.
- Training a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.
- Evaluating the model using standard regression metrics such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R²-score.
- Visualizing regression results using scatter plots and regression lines.
- Allowing the user to input experience and obtain a predicted salary value.
- Providing complete documentation, system design, and GitHub version control as required.

Limitations:
- The model uses only one independent feature (years of experience).
- The dataset is small and intended for educational purposes.
